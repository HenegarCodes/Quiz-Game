# Quiz-Game

## Description

Built this to create a simple quiz game to learn more javascript utilizing web APIs. I learned a lot about local storage and enabling me to convert items using JSON and Parse. But I really enjoyed the timer function. It took quite sometime. I had to change Ids because i didnt make a ton of different ones. SO i went through about 3 times changing IDs because i made 3/4 too simliar.
